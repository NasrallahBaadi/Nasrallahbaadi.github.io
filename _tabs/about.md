Hi everyone! I'm Nasrallah Baadi, a Cybersecurity enthusiast, a self-taught Hacker and CTF player, i spend most of my time learning new things related to Cybersecurity and practicing what i have learned on different platforms such as:TryHackMe - HackTheBox - PicoCTF - RootMe - HackThisSite - OverTheWire ... and my goal is to be a Penetration Tester.

```terminal
nasrallah@github:~/about$ nmap -A
```

In this website, i post walkthroughs and write-ups for the machines and CTFs i solve in those platforms as well as other things.
The goals behind this are:
 - Share knowledge that might help people.
 - Document what I learn.
