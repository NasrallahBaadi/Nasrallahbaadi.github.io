# **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. Today we are going to look at [Fawn](https://app.hackthebox.com/starting-point?tier=0) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com). It's a very easy machine from Starting Point.

# **Enumeration**
## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```Terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.129.1.14 (10.129.1.14)
Host is up (0.34s latency).

```

Port 21 is open with anonymous login enabled.

# **Foothold**

Anonymous login let us login to ftp with the username `anonymous` and a blank password.

Let's the content of the current directory.

We found flag.txt file, we need to download it to our machine in order to see it's content, to do that, we can use the command `get flag.txt`.
