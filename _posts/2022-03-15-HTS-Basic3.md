# **Solution**

Let's navigate to the challenge page.

Sam fixed the problem and uploaded the password file, let's check the source code.

![pass](/assets/img/hackthissite/basic/bm3/pass.png)

There is a hidden field named **file** and it's value is **password.php**, so that might be the password file Sam uploaded, let's navigate to it: `https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/3/password.php`.

Great! It is the password file, submit the password and let's move to the next challenge.
