# **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. We will be doing [Basic mission 11](https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/10/) from [HackThisSite](https://www.hackthissite.org/). It is the last challenge of this series.

# **Solution**

According to the description, we have a music site, and it has something to do with Apache. Let's navigate to the challenge page.

![](/assets/img/hackthissite/basic/bm11/1.png)

We got a message, and every time we refresh the webpage we get similar messages.
> I love my music! "Candle in the Wind" is the best! 
> I love my music! "Sick City" is the best!
> I love my music! "The King Must Die" is the best! 

I googled these sentences and got this.

They are songs from someone called Elton John.

Let's view the source code of the page.

There is a comment saying there are more stuff if we can find it. Let's try running a directory/file scan. `gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/small.txt -u https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/11/ -x php`

```Terminal
$ gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/small.txt -u https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/11/ -x php

```

We found **/e** directory, let's see what's there.

![](/assets/img/hackthissite/basic/bm11/5.png)

we found another directory, and even more directories. Following them we get this.

![](/assets/img/hackthissite/basic/bm11/6.png)

Elton, the singer we found earlier, but this directory is empty.

One of the hints we got is that Sam doesn't understand Apache. Some of the import files in Apache are `.htaccess` files, they are configuration files for the Apache web server that can be used to override certain server configuration options on a per-directory basis using a human readable file.

If their contents are exposed, attackers can gain valuable insight into te server configuration and may read sensitive datal.

If we run another directory/file scan, we can see that the file is readable.

```Terminal
$ gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -u https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/11/e/l/t/o/n/                                    1 тип

/.htpasswd            (Status: 403) [Size: 15033]
```

Let's see what it holds.

![](/assets/img/hackthissite/basic/bm11/7.png)

Beside `.htaccess`, there is another file on the directory, `DaAnswer`

![](/assets/img/hackthissite/basic/bm11/8.png)

We got the message : **The answer is not here! Just look a little harder.** This is really confusing, but if we think a little, the answer is **not here**.

Now we need a place to submit the password. From our first directory scan, we found **index.php** page, and this is where we submit the password.

![](/assets/img/hackthissite/basic/bm11/9.png)

Now enter the password '**not here**' and submit it.
