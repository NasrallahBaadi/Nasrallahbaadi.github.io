# **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [LazyAdmin](https://tryhackme.com/room/lazyadmin) from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com). We find a webserver running a vulnerable 

# **Enumeration**
## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```Terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.151.18
Host is up (0.099s latency).

```

We got ssh on port 22 and a http webserver on port 80, let's check the webserver.


## Webserver

Let's navigate to the web page.

It's the default page of Apache, nothing useful, let's run directory scan.

## Gobuster

===============================================================
```

We found a directory called **/content**, let's navigate to it.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/lazyadmin/l2.png)

We found a welcome page of **SweetRice** website management system, I searched for SweetRice on [Exploitdb](https://www.exploit-db.com/) and found that it has a backup disclosure vulnerability, this [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40718) explains how to get a mysql backup.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/lazyadmin/l3.png)

We can navigate to `http://{target_IP}/inc/mysql_backup` and find a mysql backup file.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/lazyadmin/l4.png)

Let's download the file to our machine and see what it has for us.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/lazyadmin/l5.png)

The file has the username **manager** and a password hash that looks like an md5 hash, so we can use [crackstation](https://crackstation.net/) to crack the password.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/lazyadmin/l6.png)

We managed to crack the password, but where to use it.

Let's run another directory scan but this time on **/content**.

===============================================================
```

Let's see what on **/as** directory, navigate to `http://{target_IP}/content/as`.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/lazyadmin/l8.png)

Great! We found a login page, let's use the credentials we found to login.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/lazyadmin/l9.png)


# **Foothold**

We have access, now what? Earlier when we searched for possible exploits, there was an *arbitrary file upload* exploit in [Exploitdb](https://www.exploit-db.com/).

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/lazyadmin/l10.png)

Download the exploit [here](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40716) and run it with `sudo python3 {exploitfile}`.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/lazyadmin/l11.png)

We need to provide the target url `{target_IP}/content`, the username `manager`, the password we managed to crack, and a php reverse shell, in my case i used this one from [pentestmonkeys](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php), the extension of the file has to be `php5` for a successful upload.

Now let's set up a listener on our machine with `nc -lvnp {port_number}` and visit the link the exploit gave us `http://target_IP/content/attachment/reverse.php5`

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/lazyadmin/l12.png)

Great! We managed to get a shell, and i used the python3 pty trick to get a functional shell, now the privesc part.


# **Privilege Escalation**

Let's check our privileges by running `sudo -l`

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/lazyadmin/l13.png)

We can run a perl script as root. We don't have write permissions on the script so let's check script does.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/lazyadmin/l14.png)

backup.pl just runs another script called copy.sh, and we have write permissions on that file.

I added the following command: `chmod +s /bin/bash`, this gives suid permission to /bin/bash so that i can run it as it's owner root, i run the perl script after that and we can see the suid bit got added to /bin/bash.

running `/bin/bash -p` will give us a root shell

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/lazyadmin/l15.png)

And just like that we have rooted **LazyAdmin**.
