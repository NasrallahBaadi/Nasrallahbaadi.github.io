# **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [c4ptur3th3fl4g](https://tryhackme.com/room/c4ptur3th3fl4g) from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com).

# **Translation & Shifting**

Translate, shift and decode the following.


## #1 : c4n y0u c4p7u23 7h3 f149?


This one looks like leetspeak, we need to replace the numbers with their corresponding letters.

0 = O | 1 = I | 2 = Z | 3 = E | 4 = A | 5 = S | 6 = G | 7 = T | 8 = B | 9 = g


`ans : can you capture the flag?`

## #2 : 01101100 01100101 01110100 01110011 00100000 01110100 01110010 01111001 00100000 01110011 01101111 01101101 01100101 00100000 01100010 01101001 01101110 01100001 01110010 01111001 00100000 01101111 01110101 01110100 00100001

This one is binary, we can go to [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) and convert it.

## #3 : MJQXGZJTGIQGS4ZAON2XAZLSEBRW63LNN5XCA2LOEBBVIRRHOM======

This one looks a base. Let's use [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/).

![](2.png)

It's a bse32.

## #4 : RWFjaCBCYXNlNjQgZGlnaXQgcmVwcmVzZW50cyBleGFjdGx5IDYgYml0cyBvZiBkYXRhLg==

This is base64.

## #5 : 68 65 78 61 64 65 63 69 6d 61 6c 20 6f 72 20 62 61 73 65 31 36 3f

This one is hex.

![](4.png)

## #6 : Ebgngr zr 13 cynprf!

I see the number 13, so i'm guessing it's rot13.

![](5.png)

## #7 : *@F DA:? >6 C:89E C@F?5 323J C:89E C@F?5 Wcf E:>6DX

This is rot47.

![](6.png)

## #8 : - . .-.. . -.-. --- -- -- ..- -. .. -.-. .- - .

This looks like morse code.

![](7.png)

## #9 : 85 110 112 97 99 107 32 116 104 105 115 32 66 67 68

This is decimal.

![](8.png)

## #10 : LS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tL

We got a very long string here, let's inspect it.

![](9.png)

We see that the string ends with an equal sign, which can be a base64.

![](10.png)

After we decoded it, it gave us a morse code.

![](11.png)

Morse code gave a hex code.

![](12.png)

The hex gives a rot47.

![](13.png)

We decode that and get decimal.

And this was the final one.

# **Spectrograms**

A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. When applied to an audio signal, spectrograms are sometimes called sonographs, voiceprints, or voicegrams. When the data is represented in a 3D plot they may be called waterfalls.

Let's download the task file and open it with `sonic-visualizer`.

```Terminal
sonic-visualiser secretaudio.wav
```

![](15.png)

Now we need to add a spectrogram layer by going to `Layer -> Add Spectrogram` or pressing `shift + G`.

# **Steganography**

Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.

Let's download the task file.

In order to extract files from images, we can use a tool called `steghide`.

```Terminal
Steghide extract -sh stegosteg.jpg`
```

After that we submit an empty password.

# **Security through obscurity**

Security through obscurity is the reliance in security engineering on the secrecy of the design or implementation as the main method of providing security for a system or component of a system.

After downloading the task file, we run the command `strings` on the file.

```Terminal
Strings meme.jpg
```

At the very end we can see the answer to the last questions.
