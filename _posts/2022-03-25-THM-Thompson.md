# **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. Today we are going to look at [Thompson](https://tryhackme.com/room/bsidesgtthompson) from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com). It's an easy machine where we find a mis-configured Apache Tomcat server that leads to an information disclosure where where get a username and password for Tomcat manager. We use an exploit that gives us a remote shell on the machine, with some enumeration we find a cronjob that runs a world writable script as root, we exploit that and get root access.

# **Enumeration**
## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.109.215

```

There are 3 open ports, port 8080 is running apache tomcat, let's navigate to the webpage at `{target_IP}:8080`

## WebPage

![the web page](/assets/img/tryhackme/thompson/webpage.png)

We see the default page of Apache Tomcat.Let's run a directory scan to see if there is anything useful.

## Gobuster

```terminal

/manager              (Status: 302) [Size: 0] [--> /manager/]
===============================================================
```

There is a **/manager** page, let's go there on `http://{target_IP}:8080/manager`.

![login_form](/assets/img/tryhackme/thompson/credsprompt.png)

We are being to enter a username and password, i tried some known credentials like admin:admin and admin:password but got nothing, if we hit `Cancel`, we see the following.

![information_disclosure](/assets/img/tryhackme/thompson/disclosure.png)

We get redirected to this unauthorized access error page, where we can find the username and password for the manager page. Now we can go and login.

![tomcat_manager](/assets/img/tryhackme/thompson/manager.png)

# **Foothold**

Now that we have access to Tomcat manager, i searched on google for ways to get code execution on tomcat, and i found a module on metasploit that can give us a shell on the machine, the module is called `exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload`.

![metasploit_tomcat_rce](/assets/img/tryhackme/thompson/metasploit.png)

We need to set the username and password of the Tomcat manager along with the other necessary options, and run the exploit.

![meterpreter](/assets/img/tryhackme/thompson/meterpreter.png)

We have successfully gained a shell on our target.


# **Privilege Escalation**

Let's do some manual enumeration on the machine.

![jack_home](/assets/img/tryhackme/thompson/jackhome.png)

We found a user named **jack**, on his home directory, there are two interesting files, **id.sh** and **test.txt**.

The **id.sh** file has a command that runs the command `id` and put the output of that command into the file **test.txt**, and in the latter file, we see the output of the `id` command that was run by root. We can also notice that from all the other files, **test.txt** got modified very lately in comparison with other files, this means that there is a cronjob running on the machine, let's check **/etc/crontab** for cron jobs.

![cronjob](/assets/img/tryhackme/thompson/crontab.png)

We found a cronjob that is run by root, and what it does is it moves to /home/jack directory and runs the id.sh script. We saw on jack's home directory that the **id.sh** file is writable. With that, we can change the content of that file and put a command on it that would permit us to become root.

![suidbash](/assets/img/tryhackme/thompson/suidbash.png)

First, i dropped a shell, used python pty trick to get a nice shell, then i put the command in **id.sh**. The command i used takes a copy of /bin/bash and put it in /tmp directory, then it gives it suid permission so that we can run it as it's owner which is root. We can run the command `/tmp/bash -p` for root

![root_access](/assets/img/tryhackme/thompson/root.png)

And just like that, we have rooted the machine.
