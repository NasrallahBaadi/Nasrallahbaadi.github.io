# **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. We will be doing [basic mission 4](https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/4/) from [HackThisSite](https://www.hackthissite.org/)

# **Solution**

Let's navigate to the challenge page.

With that information, let's check the source code for anything useful.

Looking through the source code, we can indeed see Sam's email address, and if we pressed `Send password to Sam` button, it tells us ***Password reminder successfully sent***.

We can use Burp Suite to intercept the request, change Sam's email to our email, and forward the request to receive the password.

## Steps

 1. Launch Burp Suite and turn intercept on.
 2. Press `Send password to Sam` button, we will be able to see that the request is intercepted by Burp.

 3. Change Sam's email to your email and turn intercept off.

Going back to our browser, we see that the password reminder successfully sent to our email.

For this to actually work, you need to use the email on your HackThisSite profile. The email you will receive will look like this.
