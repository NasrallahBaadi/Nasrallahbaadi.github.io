# **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Inclusion](https://tryhackme.com/room/inclusion) from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com). It's an easy machine where we use local file inclusion vulnerability and find a user credentials that gives us access to the machine via ssh. We Find we can run a program as root, we leverage that to become root.

# **Enumeration**
## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```Terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.210.218

```

We have ssh on port 22 and a webserver running on port 80, let's check the webserver.

## Webserver

It looks like we have a blog with some articles, let's try clicking on one of the `view details` buttons.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/inclusion/i2.png)

We see in the URL a parameter called `name`, let's see if it's vulnerable to Local file inclusion by requesting the `/etc/passwd` file, but first, we need to up all the way the root directory of the file system, the payload will like this: `../../../../../etc/passwd`.

Let's add it now to the url, `http://{target_IP}/article?name=../../../../../etc/passwd`

>Note that we use `ctrl + u` to view the source code which gives us a nicer view.

We found a username and password inside the file.


# **Foothold**

Let's use the username and password we found to login with ssh.

Great! We are in the machine now, let's move to privesc.

# **Privilege Escalation**

We can run `sudo -l` to check our current privileges.

We can run `socat` as root, we can go to [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) and see how to use socat to get root.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/inclusion/i6.png)

So we can execute the following command `sudo socat stdin exec:/bin/sh` and become root, let's try it.

Great! And just like that we have rooted the machine.
