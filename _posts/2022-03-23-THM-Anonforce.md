# **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. Today we are going to look at [Anonforce](https://tryhackme.com/room/bsidesgtanonforce) from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com), an easy machine where we are able to login to ftp as anonymous and see all of the system files of the machine, we find an unusual directory that contains an encrypted file, we decrypt it and get some hashes that we will be able to crack one of them and get root access.

# **Enumeration**
## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.175.75

There are two open port, 21(FTP) and 22(SSH).

## FTP

From the nmap scan, anonymous login seems to be enabled on the ftp server. Let's login by typing the following command `ftp {target_IP}`, for the username enter **anonymous** and password can be submitted blank.

![ftp](/assets/img/tryhackme/anonforce/ftp.png)


# **Foothold**

We see that we are in the root of the file system of a linux machine. Looking at these directories/files, we see an unusual directory called **notread**, let's see what's there.

![files](/assets/img/tryhackme/anonforce/files.png)

There is a pgp encrypted file named **backup.pgp** and file named **private.asc** which seems to be private key for the encrypted file, let's get those file into our attacking machine. We can do that by running `get filename` on the ftp prompt.

We can also navigate to the home page and file a user that have the user flag, use `get user.txt` to download the file to your machine.

![user](/assets/img/tryhackme/anonforce/user.png)

After getting those 2 file, we can use the command `gpg` to decrypt the file. First we need to import the private key, we can do that with the following command `gpg --import private.asc`, and to decrypt it we can run `gpg --output backup --decrypt backup.pgp`

![decr1](/assets/img/tryhackme/anonforce/decr1.png)

We were asked for a password when we tried to decrypt the file, that's because the private key is protected with a password. We can use `gpg2john` to get a hash and use `john` to crack that hash.

![hash](/assets/img/tryhackme/anonforce/keyhash.png)

Great! We managed to crack the hash and get the private key's password, let's decrypt the file now.

![passwd](/assets/img/tryhackme/anonforce/passwd.png)

After decrypting the file, we get a copy of shadow file that contains password hashes for **melodias** and **root**.

# **Privilege Escalation**

Let's try to crack the root hash with `hashcat`, first copy the hash to a file and run the command `hashcat -m 1800 roothash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

![hash](/assets/img/tryhackme/anonforce/rootpass.png)

Great! We managed to crack the root hash, let's now ssh to the machine and grab the flag.
