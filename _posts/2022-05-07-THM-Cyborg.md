# **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing []() from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com).

# **Enumeration**
## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```Terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.29.122
Host is up (0.092s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION

```

We have ssh on port 22 and http on port 80.

## Web

Let's navigate to the webserver.

It's the default page for apache. Let's run a directory scan.

```Terminal

```

We found **/admin** and **/etc**. Let's visit admin page.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/2.png)

let's look through the page to see if we can find anything useful.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/3.png)

We found out that there is a backup called music_archive, also Alex has made some changes that made the site insecure.

In the archive tab, we see that we can download an archive.tar file, so let's do that.

Move on the the next directory we found "**/etc/**".

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/4.png)

There is another directory, let's see what's in it.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/5.png)

We found 2 files, **passwd** and **squid.conf**.

The passwd file has a hash for music_archive, let's copy that hash to a file on our machine and try to crack it.

Using `hash-identifier`, we find that our hash is `MD5(APR)`. We can use `hashcat` with the mode 1600 to crack the hash.

`hashcat -m 1600 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/6.png)

Great! We managed to crack the hash and get a password.

Let's now take a look at the archive.tar file we downloaded before. We can extract it using `tar -xvf archive.tar`

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/7.png)

We found a readme file that tells us this is a borg backup repository, and points us to a webpage.

Looking through the documentation, we found a way to extract archives.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/8.png)

Let's try to extract the music_archive Alex talked about since we managed to crack the password.

First, we need to download borgbackup, we can do that with the following command: `sudo apt install borgbackup`

Second, we need to run this command : `borg extract ./home/field/dev/final_archive::music_archive` and submit the password.

# **Foothold**

Now let's see what we extracted.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/10.png)

We got Alex's home page, let's look through it to see if we can find any useful information.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/11.png)

Great! We got Alex's password, let's use it and login with ssh.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/12.png)


# **Privilege Escalation**

Let's check our current privileges by running `sudo -l`.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/13.png)

We can run backup.sh file as root, let's check this file.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/14.png)

We can see that we are the owner of this file, so we can modify it as we like. Let's make it run `/bin/bash`.

First, we need to add write permission because it's not writable and then add our code. 

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/15.png)

Great! Now let's run the script `sudo /etc/mp3backups/backup.sh`.
