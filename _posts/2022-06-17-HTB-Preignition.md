# **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. Today we are going to look at [Preignition](https://app.hackthebox.com/starting-point?tier=0) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com).

# **Enumeration**
## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.129.200.99 (10.129.200.99)
Host is up (0.20s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp open  http    nginx 1.14.2
|_http-server-header: nginx/1.14.2
|_http-title: Welcome to nginx!
```

We have a linux machine running nginx 1.14.2 on port 80.

## Web

let's navigate to the webpage.

It's the default page of nginx.

## Gobuster

Let's run directory scan:`gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -u http://10.129.200.99/`

```terminal

===============================================================

```

Found /admin.php page. Let's navigate to it.

It's a login page.

# **Foothold**

The first things to do when presented with a login page is to try some default credentials like : admin:admin - admin:password - root:root.

Let's try them.

We managed to login using admin:admin.
