# **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [H4cked](https://tryhackme.com/room/h4cked) from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com).

# Task1

Let's download the task file, open it with wireshark and start investigating.

![wireshark](1.png)

In the first packets of the capture, we see the attacker trying to connect to port 21, which is FTP.

![](2.png)

We see the attacker attempting to login to an ftp server trying multiple passwords with the user `jenny`. He must be using `hydra` to brute force the login.

![](3.png)

If we scrolled down through the packets we can see a successful login.

![](4.png)

To view the password, right click the packet and follow tcp stream.

![](5.png)

Scrolling down the packets, we can see the hackers own attempt after he stopped brute forcing.

![](6.png)

Right click one of those packets and follow tcp stream.

Here we can see what the hacked did before exiting.

After the attacked had logged in successfully, he was in `/var/www/html` directory, uploaded a file called `shell.php`, gave it full permissions and exited after that.

We can see that he requested that file after that from his attacking machine, which gave his a reverse shell on the machine.

Let's now follow the tcp stream of that reverse shell and what did the attacker do.

![](9.png)

After gaining a shell, the attacking run the command `whoami` to see what user's account he is using, and it was `www-data`.

Since he knows jenny's password, the attacker changed to that user with the command `su jenny` after stabilizing his shell with the command `python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`.

The attacker checked jenny's permissions on the machine with the command `sudo -l`, and he found that he can run any command as root, so he simply changed the user to root with `sudo su`.

We can see after that he cloned a repo from github called `reptile`, which is a rootkit.

# Task2

The attacker has changed jenny's password, so let's replicate his steps and try to get into the machine.

# **Enumeration**
## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```Terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.3.106 (10.10.3.106)
Host is up (0.064s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 2.0.8 or later
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-title: Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page: It works
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
```

We see ftp on port 21 and http on port 80.

# **Foothold**

Same as the hacker, let's start brute forcing ftp server with hydra. `hydra -l jenny -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.3.106 ftp`

![](10.png)

Great! We got the password, now let's download the reverse shell code the attacker used [here](http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/php-reverse-shell).

Before uploading the file, we need to change the ip address to the one of our attacking machine.

Now let's login the the ftp server and upload the shell.
![](11.png)

After logging successfully, i used the command `put` to upload the reverse shell code (reverse.php), and don't forget to change permission like i did, use `chmod 777 reverse.php`.

Set up a netcat listener `nc -lvnp 1234`, and request the reverse.php file we uploaded, i used curl to do that. `curl http://10.10.10.10/reverse.php`

![](12.png)

Great! We got the reverse shell.

# **Privilege Escalation**

For this part, we saw the hacker use jenny's ability to run any command as root and change the user to root, let's do that.

First, let's run this command `python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'` to stabilize our shell.

Change the user to jenny using the password found earlier, and run `sudo su` to change user to root.
