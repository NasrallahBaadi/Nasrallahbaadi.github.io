# **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. We will be doing [Uncle Arnold's Local Band Review](https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/1/) from [HackThisSite](https://www.hackthissite.org/) which is part of the **realistic missions**.


# **Solution**

The challenge has the following message.

Let's navigate to that [page](https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/1/).

It's a local brand review page, if we scroll down, we can see Raging Inferno is at the bottom and has the lowest rank.

Let's fire up `burp suite` and turn intercept on.

Now let's vote for our Raging Inferno brand and intercept the request.

We can see the parameter responsible for voting is named `vote`, so let's change it's value to something higher.

Let's forward the request.
