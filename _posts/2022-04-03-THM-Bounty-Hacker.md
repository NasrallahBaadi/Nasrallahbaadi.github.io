# **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Bounty Hacker](https://tryhackme.com/room/cowboyhacker) from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com)

# **Enumeration**
## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```Terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.120.252
Host is up (0.11s latency).
Not shown: 970 filtered tcp ports (no-response), 27 closed tcp ports (reset)

```

We got 3 open ports
 - 21 ftp vsftpd 3.0.3
 - 22 ssh OpenSSH 7.2p2
 - 80 http Apache httpd 2.4.18

## FTP

From the nmap scan we see that Anonymous login is allowed is this ftp server, let's login and see what we can find.

We found two interesting files, locks.txt and task.txt, we can download them to our machine using the command `get {filename}`. Let's see what's on the files.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/bountyhunter/b2.png)

The first file, locks.txt, contains a list of words that i assume are passwords, the other file, task.txt, contains a notes from someone called **lin**, which is a possible username. Now we the information we have, let's try to brute force ssh and see if we can find something.


# **Foothold**

To brute force ssh, we can use `hydra`.

We managed to get the correct password for **lin**, let's login with ssh now.

# **Privilege Escalation**

Now that we have access to the machine, let's what we can do.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/bountyhunter/b5.png)

By running `sudo -l`, we see that we can run `/usr/tar` as **root**,  we can use [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) to see how we can leverage that and get root.

We can use that command to get a root shell.

And just like that we became root.
