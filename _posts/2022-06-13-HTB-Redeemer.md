# **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. Today we are going to look at [Redeemer](https://app.hackthebox.com/starting-point?tier=0) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com). It's part of Tier 0 machines from Starting Point. The machines is running redis server.

# **Enumeration**
## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 -p- {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```Terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.129.190.211 (10.129.190.211)
Host is up (0.18s latency).
Not shown: 65534 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT     STATE SERVICE
6379/tcp open  redis   Redis key-value store 5.0.7
```

Port 6379 ios open running `redis`.

Redis (**RE**mote **DI**ctionary **S**erver) is an open-source advanced NoSQL key-value data store used as a database, cache, and message broker. The data is stored in a dictionary format having key-value pairs. It is typically used for short term storage of data that needs fast retrieval. Redis does backup data to hard drives to provide consistency.

# **Redis**

Let's connect to redis server with the following command: `redis-cli -h 10.129.190.211`.
 - -h <hostname> : specify the hostname of the target to connect to.

We see a prompt in the terminal after we connect successfully.

One of the basic Redis enumeration commands is info which returns information and statistics about the
Redis server.

```Ternimal
$ redis-cli -h 10.129.190.211                                                                                                                      130 тип

```

The keyspace section provides statistics on the main dictionary of each database. The statistics include the
number of keys, and the number of keys with an expiration.

Here we can see that there is only one database with index 0 and 4 keys.

Let's select the database with `select 0`.

We can now list all the keys in the database with the command : `KEYS *`.

![](3.png)

To view the value of a key, we use `get {key}`.
