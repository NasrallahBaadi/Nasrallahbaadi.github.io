# **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. We will be doing [Basic mission 9](https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/9/) from [HackThisSite](https://www.hackthissite.org/).

# **Solution**

Let's navigate the challenge page.

![](/assets/img/hackthissite/basic/bm9/1.png)

In this level, the password is saved in /9 directory, the script that takes user input and save it in a file is not here, but we can go back to level 8 and use to try to get to the password file.

We can use the same payload as last level, but we need to do a slight modification to it. `<!--#exec cmd="ls ../../9" -->`. Since the password is in **/9** directory, we need to go two directories up and list the content of **/9**.

Great! We got the password file name, navigate to it to get the password.
