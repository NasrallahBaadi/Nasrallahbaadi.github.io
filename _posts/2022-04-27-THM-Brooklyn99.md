# **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Brooklyn Nine Nine](https://tryhackme.com/room/brooklynninenine) from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com).

# **Enumeration**
## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```Terminal

```

There are 3 open ports, FTP on port 21, SSH on port 22, and HTTP on port 80. Let's start with FTP.

## FTP

Let's login to the ftp server as anonymous. `ftp {target_IP}`.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/brooklyn/1.png)

We found a text file, let's download it to our machine with the command `get {filename}`.

Now let's see what's on that file.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/brooklyn/2.png)

It's a note from Amy to Jake saying that Jake's password is too weak.

## Web

Let's navigate to the webpage.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/brooklyn/8.png)

We have a picture of Brooklyn nine-nine and some text, let's view the source code `ctrl+u`.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/brooklyn/9.png)

We found an HTML comment talking about steganography

# **Foothold**

## Method 1

Let's use `hydra` to brute force Jake's password. `hydra -l jake -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.168.172 ssh -t 30`

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/brooklyn/3.png)

Great! We got Jake's password, let's login.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/brooklyn/4.png)

And we're in.

## Method 2

First, let's download the picture to our machine using this command. `wget http://{target_ip}/brooklyn99.jpg}`.
Now let's use `steghide` to extract any hidden files on the picture.`steghide --extract -sf brooklyn99.jpg`.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/brooklyn/10.png)

The file is protected with a password.

Let's use [stegseek](https://github.com/RickdeJager/stegseek) to get that password.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/brooklyn/11.png)

Great! We got the password and extracted the data successfully. Let's see what we got.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/brooklyn/12.png)

We got Holt's password. Let's use it to login.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/brooklyn/13.png)

We're in. To privesc.

# **Privilege Escalation**

## Jake

Let's check our current privileges by running `sudo -l`.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/brooklyn/5.png)

We can execute the command `less` as root, let's take a look at [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) for exploits.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/brooklyn/6.png)


We found a way to get root access by executing some commands, so let's run them.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/brooklyn/7.png)

Good! We are root now.

## Holt

Let's check our privileges with `sudo -l`.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/brooklyn/14.png)

We can run nano as root, let's go to [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) and see if there is a way to exploit that.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/brooklyn/15.png)

Good, we found a way.

 First, run the command `sudo nano`, now that you are in the nano editor, press `ctrl+R` + `ctrl+X`, after that, enter the command `reset; sh 1>&0 2>&0`, it should look like this.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/brooklyn/16.png)

Now press Enter to execute the command.
>Note: you might need to press enter multiple time to get a clear shell.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/brooklyn/17.png)

And just like that, we got root.
