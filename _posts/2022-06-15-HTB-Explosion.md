# **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. Today we are going to look at [Explosion](https://app.hackthebox.com/starting-point?tier=0) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com).

# **Enumeration**
## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.129.190.225 (10.129.190.225)        
Host is up (0.29s latency).

```

We see that we are dealing with a windows machine running smb and RDP on port 3389.

# **Foothold**

Let's try to connect to RDP using `xfreerdp`.

The script need some switches for it to try to connect to the target.

 - /u:{username} : Specifies the login username.
 - /v:{target_IP} : Specifies the target IP of the host we would like to connect to.

We will be login as user **Administrator** and submit a blank.

`xfreerdp /v:10.129.190.225 /u:Administrator`

Wait a little bit and we get a GUI access to the target as Administrator.

For better access, use the following command `xfreerdp /v:10.129.190.225 /u:Administrator /dynamic-resolution +clipboard`. This will allow us to us clipboard and resize the pane.
