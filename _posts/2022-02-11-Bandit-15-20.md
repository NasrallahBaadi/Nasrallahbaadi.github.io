# **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. In today's episode, we will be doing Level 15 -> Level 20 of [Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) from [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/). Let's connect to **bandit15** and start.

# **Level 15 -> Level 16**

## Goal

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL encryption.

## Solution

We need to connect to localhost on the specified port using SSL encryption, so telnet will not work because is sends everything unencrypted.  
One of the commands we can use is `openssl` with subcommand `s_client`. If we read the description in the man page of this command it says: **The s_client command implements a generic SSL/TLS client which connects to a remote host using SSL/TLS.**
That's great, so we can use this command to connect to a host using SSH encryption. We need to specify some option first.
 - **-quiet** : This option inhibits printing of session and certificate information, cause our goal is to only to submit the password.
 - **-connect** : This option specifies the host and optional port to connect to.

Now our final command looks like this:`openssl s_client -quiet -connect localhost:30001`

```terminal
bandit15@bandit:~$ openssl s_client -quiet -connect localhost:30001
depth=0 CN = localhost
verify error:num=18:self signed certificate
verify return:1
depth=0 CN = localhost
verify return:1

# **Level 16 -> Level 17**

## Goal

The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

## Solution

I first run `netstat` to see listening ports but it didn't work. Next, i checked if nmap is installed and BINGO, it is. Running a scan with specifying port 31000 to 32000 gives the following.

```terminal
bandit16@bandit:~$ which nmap
/usr/bin/nmap
bandit16@bandit:~$ nmap -p31000-32000 localhost

Starting Nmap 7.40 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-02-18 18:20 CET

```

Not really helpful, Let's run a service scan with **-sV** option.

```terminal
bandit16@bandit:~$ nmap -sV -p31000-32000 localhost

Great, we got our port. The ports that has **echo** as a service are the one that sends back whatever we give them, the only port that doesn't and has SSH encryption is **31790**

```terminal
bandit16@bandit:~$ openssl s_client -quiet -connect localhost:31790
depth=0 CN = localhost
verify error:num=18:self signed certificate
verify return:1
depth=0 CN = localhost

Great, it worked, and we got a private ssh key, let's copy it and put it in a file on our machine, give it the right permission and connect to bandit17 with it.

bandit17@bandit:~$
```

# **Level 17 -> Level 18**

## Goal

There are 2 files in the homedirectory: passwords.old and passwords.new. The password for the next level is in passwords.new and is the only line that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new

NOTE: if you have solved this level and see ‘Byebye!’ when trying to log into bandit18, this is related to the next level, bandit19

## Solution

### My method

The way i first solved this challenge was by printing the two files, sorting the output and used `uniq` to be left with the two strings that got changed, and one of them is the password.

```terminal
bandit17@bandit:~$ cat passwords.* | sort | uniq -u
kfBf3eYk5BPBRzwjqutbbfE887SVc5Yd
w0Yfolrc5bwjS4qw5mq1nnQi6mF03bii
```

### Other method

We can simply use `diff` to compare the files line by line.

```terminal
bandit17@bandit:~$ diff passwords.new passwords.old
42c42
< kfBf3eYk5BPBRzwjqutbbfE887SVc5Yd
---
> w0Yfolrc5bwjS4qw5mq1nnQi6mF03bii
```

# **Level 18 -> Level 19**

## Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file readme in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified .bashrc to log you out when you log in with SSH.

## Solution

This one mad me lose my mind. Every time we connect to bandit18 we get the following.

```terminal
Byebye !
Connection to bandit.labs.overthewire.org closed.
```
As described in the Goal, we get logged out everytime we log in with ssh, so we can try to execute a command that prints readme file without waiting to get a shell.

```terminal
┌──(sirius㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 cat readme   
This is a OverTheWire game server. More information on http://www.overthewire.org/wargames

bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password:
IueksS7Ubh8G3DCwVzrTd8rAVOwq3M5x
```

# **Level 19 -> Level 20**

## Goal

To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.

## Solution

Let's first see what the command does.

```terminal
bandit19@bandit:~$ ls -l
total 8
-rwsr-x--- 1 bandit20 bandit19 7296 May  7  2020 bandit20-do
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do
Run a command as another user.
  Example: ./bandit20-do id
```

It runs a command as another user, and it gives us an example.

```terminal
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do id
uid=11019(bandit19) gid=11019(bandit19) euid=11020(bandit20) groups=11019(bandit19)
```

We see that we ran `id` as bandit20, so we might as well read /etc/bandi_pass/bandit20 which contains bandi20's password

```terminal
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j
bandit19@bandit:~$
```

Thank you for taking the time to read my writeup, I hope you have learned something with this, if you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to me. See you in the next hack :) .
