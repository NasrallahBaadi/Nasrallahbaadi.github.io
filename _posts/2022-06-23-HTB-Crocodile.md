# **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. Today we are going to look at [Crocodile](https://app.hackthebox.com/starting-point?tier=1) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com).

# **Enumeration**
## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.129.1.15 (10.129.1.15)
Host is up (0.17s latency).

```

We found 2 open ports, 21 running a ftp server that allows anonymous login, and port 80 running apache web server.

## FTP

Let's login to the ftp server and download the files there.

![](1.png)

Let's see what's on those file.

![](2.png)

We have a list of username and a list of password.

## Web

Navigate to the webpage. http://10.129.1.15/

![](3.png)

It's a Bootstrap Business Template, nothing useful for us.

## Gobuster

Let's run a directory scan using gobuster:`gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -u http://10.129.1.15/`

```terminal

===============================================================
```

There is /dashboard page. Let's navigate to it.

![](4.png)

We get redirected to a login page.

# **Foothold**

Let's use the username and password lists we found earlier and attempt to login.

Since we have a small list, no need for an automated tool. But we will do it anyway for demonstration purposes. 

First thing we need is the name of the parameters used for the login, for that, we either use burp suite and intercept the login request or just use the developer tool of the browser, we will use the latter.

Press `F12` and got to network tab. 

Now submit a test username and password (admin:admin for example) and try to login.

![](7.png)

Here we can see that there is three parameters; Username, Password and Submit.

The username and password parameters' values are the ones we're going to brute force, the Submit value will stay 'Login'.

Next thing we need is an error message of a failed login so the script knows when we get a successful login.

![](5.png)

Now it's time to craft the command. `hydra -L allowed.userlist -P allowed.userlist.passwd 10.129.1.15 http-post-form "/login.php:Username=^USER^&Password=^PASS^&Submit='Login':Incorrect"`.

![](8.png)

Great! We got the valid credentials. Let's login.
