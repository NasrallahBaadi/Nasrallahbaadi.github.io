# **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Stuntman Mike]() from [PwnTillDawn](https://online.pwntilldawn.com/) and [Wizlynxgroup](https://www.wizlynxgroup.com). This is an easy linux machine, running a ssh server on port 22 and a webserver on port 8089. When we try to connect to ssh, the server reveals some useful information, we use that to brute force ssh and we find valid credentials. After login to the machine via ssh, we find that we can run any command as root, so we can easily change user to root. Let's get started.

# **Enumeration**
## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```Terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.150.150.166

```

There are two open ports, 22(SSH) and 8089(ssl/http).

## Web

Let's navigate to the webserver https://10.150.150.166:8089

The webserver is running splunkd version 8.0.0, which there no vulnerabilities on this version.

## SSH

Let's try to connect to ssh.

Wow, we got the flag and a username.

# **Foothold**

Let's brute force ssh using `hydra`.

![](/assets/img/pwntilldawn/stuntman/3.png)

Great! We got the password for mike. Let's login.

```Bash
$ ssh mike@10.150.150.166
You are attempting to login to stuntman mike's server - FLAG35=724a2734e80ddbd78b2694dc5eb74db395403360
mike@10.150.150.166's password:

# **Privilege Escalation**

Let's check our privileges wit `sudo-l`

```Bash
mike@stuntmanmike:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for mike: 
Matching Defaults entries for mike on stuntmanmike:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User mike may run the following commands on stuntmanmike:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL
mike@stuntmanmike:~$
```

Great! We can run any command as root.

Let's get a root shell by running `sudo su -`

```Bash
mike@stuntmanmike:~$ sudo su -
[sudo] password for mike: 
root@stuntmanmike:~# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
root@stuntmanmike:~#
```
