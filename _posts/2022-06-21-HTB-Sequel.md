# **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. Today we are going to look at [Sequel](https://app.hackthebox.com/starting-point?tier=1) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com).

# **Enumeration**
## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.129.95.232 (10.129.95.232)
Host is up (0.14s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (reset)

Port 3306 is open and running mysql. MySQL is a service designed for database management: creating, modifying, and updating databases, changing and adding data, and more.

# **Foothold**

In order to communicate with the mysql database, we need a username and password, but sometimes there might be a misconfiguration allowing a passwordless authentication.

To connect we use the command `mysql` with the following switches.

 - -h : Connect to host.
 - -u : User for log-in if not current user.

As an initial attempt, we will try to log-in as the root user, naturally having the highest level of privileges on the system.

Great! We managed to login without a password. We are placed in a MySQL service shell from where we can explore the tables and data therein that are available to us.

The commands we will be using are the following:

 - SHOW databases; : Prints out the databases we can access.
 - USE {database_name}; : Set to use the database named {database_name}.
 - SHOW tables; : Prints out the available tables inside the current database.
 - SELECT * FROM {table_name}; : Prints out all the data from the table {table_name}.

Let's list the available databases with `SHOW databases;`.

To be able to see what's inside a database, we need to select it. We can use the command `USE {database}` to do that. In our case, the `htb` database seems relevant for our exercise so let's select it.

The next move is to prints our the available tables inside the `htb` database. We use the command `SHOW tables;`.

There are two tables. Let's check their content with the `SELECT * FROM {table_name};` command.
