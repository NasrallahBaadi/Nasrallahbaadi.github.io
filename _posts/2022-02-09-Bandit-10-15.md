# **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. In today's episode, we will be doing Level 10 -> Level 15 of [Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) from [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/). Let's connect to **bandit10** and start.

# **Level 10 -> Level 11**

## **Goal**

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data

## **Solution**

We can use `base64` with **-d** to decode the file.

```terminal
bandit10@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt
bandit10@bandit:~$ cat data.txt
VGhlIHBhc3N3b3JkIGlzIElGdWt3S0dzRlc4TU9xM0lSRnFyeEUxaHhUTkViVVBSCg==
bandit10@bandit:~$ base64 -d data.txt
The password is IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbxxx
```

# **Level 11 -> Level 12**

## **Goal**

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions

## **Solution**

From the description, the file content is encoded with rot13.

```terminal
bandit11@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt
bandit11@bandit:~$ cat data.txt
Gur cnffjbeq vf 5Gr8L4qetPEsPk8htqjhRK8XSP6x2xxx
```

Indeed it is, we can write a python script to decode the strings or just simply go to google and search for rot13. This site [Rot13](https://rot13.com) can decode the strings for us.

# **Level 12 -> Level 13**

## **Goal**

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

## **Solution**

Fot this level, we need to create a directory in **/tmp** in order to be able to write files, move to that directory, and copy the data.txt file to us.

```terminal
bandit12@bandit:~$ mkdir /tmp/hack
bandit12@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/hack
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ cp ~/data.txt .
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ ls
data.txt
```

If we read the file, we see that it is hexdump, we can change that using `xxd` with **-r** to convert the file to it's precious form, and then we need to write the output to a file.

```terminal
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ xxd -r data.txt > file
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ ls
data.txt  file.txt
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ file file.txt
```

In the Goal, we've been told that the file has been repeatedly compressed, let's use `file` to determine the type of **file.txt**

```terminal
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ file file.txt
file.txt: gzip compressed data, was "data2.bin", last modified: Thu May  7 18:14:30 2020, max compression, from Unix
```

It's a gzip compressed file. We need to rename it from **file.txt** to **file.gz** to be able to decompress it.

```terminal
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ ls
data.txt  file.txt
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ mv file.txt file.gz
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ ls
data.txt  file.gz
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ gzip -d file.gz
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ ls
data.txt  file
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ file file
file: bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900k

```

Great, we decompressed the file successfully, and we got a file called **file** and it is also compressed with `bzip2`, let's rename the file to **file.bz2** and decompress it using `bzip2 -d`

```terminal
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ mv file file.bz2
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ ls
data.txt  file.bz2
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ bzip2 -d file.bz2
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ ls
data.txt  file
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ file file
file: gzip compressed data, was "data4.bin", last modified: Thu May  7 18:14:30 2020, max compression, from Unix
```

Now we have gzip compressed file, I assume you know what to do now.

```terminal
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ mv file file.gz
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ gzip -d file.gz
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ ls
data.txt  file
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ file file
file: POSIX tar archive (GNU)
```

We now have tar compressed file.

```terminal
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ mv file file.tar
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ tar -xvf file.tar
data5.bin
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ ls
data5.bin  data.txt  file.tar
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ file data5.bin
data5.bin: POSIX tar archive (GNU)
```

Another tar compressed file.

```terminal
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ mv data5.bin data.tar
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ tar -xvf data.tar
data6.bin
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ file data6.bin
data6.bin: bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900k
```

Now a **bzip2** compressed file.

```terminal
andit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ mv data6.bin data6.bz2
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ bzip2 -d data6.bz2
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ ls
data6  data.tar  data.txt  file.tar
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ file data6
data6: POSIX tar archive (GNU)
```

We got a **tar** compressed file

```terminal
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ mv data6 data6.tar
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ tar -xfv data6.tar
tar: v: Cannot open: No such file or directory
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ tar -xvf data6.tar
data8.bin
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ file data8.bin
data8.bin: gzip compressed data, was "data9.bin", last modified: Thu May  7 18:14:30 2020, max compression, from Unix
```

I know what you thinking right now, is this ever going to end?! No worries, i was asking the same question. Let's decompress this gzip file.

```terminal
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ mv data8.bin data8.gz
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ gzip -d data8.gz
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ ls
data6.tar  data8  data.tar  data.txt  file.tar
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ file data8
data8: ASCII text
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$ cat data8
The password is 8ZjyCRiBWFYkneahHwxCv3wb2a1ORxxx
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/hack$
```

 Finally, we finished the decompression and got our password.

# **Level 13 -> Level 14**

## **Goal**

The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on

## **Solution**

With a private SSH key, we can connect without providing a password, so let's copy the content of **sshkey.private** file and put it in a file in our machine. Normaly, the file that holds the private key get named **id_rsa**, you can name whatever you want. We can connect by adding `-i {private_key}` after ssh command, the full command would be like this `ssh -i {private_key} bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`

```terminal
$ ssh -i id_rsa bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220                                                                                         130 ⨯

```

"Wait, you said we don't need a password!"

Yes, but for the private key to do it's job, it needs to have certain file permissions (600), we need to change it's permissions using `chmod 600 {private_key}`, which mean that only the owner of the file can read and write the file.

```terminal
$ chmod 600 id_rsa                                                                                                                                   130 ⨯

$ ssh -i id_rsa bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

Linux bandit.otw.local 5.4.8 x86_64 GNU/Linux

bandit14@bandit:~$
```

The password for bandit14 is located in **/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14**.

```terminal
bandit14@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3xxx
```

# **Level 14 -> Level 15**

## **Goal**

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.

## **Solution**

We can use `telnet` to connect to localhost on port 30000 and submit the password.

```terminal
bandit14@bandit:~$ telnet localhost 30000                                     
Trying 127.0.0.1...                                                        
Connected to localhost.

Correct!
