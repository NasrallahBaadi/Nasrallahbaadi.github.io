# **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Lyan_yu](https://tryhackme.com/room/lianyu) from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com).

# **Enumeration**
## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```Terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.247.111

```

We found 4 open ports, let's enumerate the webserver on port 80.

## Web

Navigating to the webpage we see the following.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/lyanyu/1.png)

It's a story about ARROWVERSE, nothing really useful in this page, let's run a directory scan.

```Terminal
# gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -u http://10.10.118.55/

===============================================================
```

We found **/island** directory, let's navigate to it.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/lyanyu/2.png)

There is a code word but we can't see it, let's view the source code.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/lyanyu/3.png)

Great! We got the code, let's save it and continue our enumeration.

Since we got nothing really useful, let's run another directory scan on **/island** page


```Terminal

===============================================================
```

We found a directory, let's see what's there.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/lyanyu/4.png)

We have a youtube video and a question. Let's again view the source code.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/lyanyu/5.png)

We got a hint that there is a ticket we can get, and it ends with *.ticket*. We can run a gobuster scan and instruct it to add the extension .ticket at the end of every search.


```Terminal
# gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -u http://10.10.118.55/island/2100/ -x ticket

/green_arrow.ticket   (Status: 200) [Size: 71]
===============================================================
```

We found our ticket, let's take a look at it.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/lyanyu/6.png)

We got what looks like an encoded text, let's go to [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) and decode it.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/lyanyu/7.png)

We managed to decode it using base58, and it looks like a password.

## FTP

Using the code we found as a username and the password we decoded, let's login to the ftp server and see what's there.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/lyanyu/8.png)

It looks like we are is vigilante's home directory, unfortunately, there is no *.ssh* directory, but there are some files in forme of images, let's download them to our machine using the command `get filename`

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/lyanyu/9.png)

Now using the command `steghide`, let's try to extract hidden file in the image **aa.jpg**

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/lyanyu/10.png)

Using *password* as a password, we managed to extract two files, one of the files has a password, but we need a username.

Going back to the ftp server, we see that we can navigate freely on the machine, and if we go to **/home** folder, we can see the users there.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/lyanyu/11.png)

Great! We got our username.


# **Foothold**

Now, let's use the credentials we managed to collect to login with ssh.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/lyanyu/12.png)

Great! Let's move to privilege escalation.


# **Privilege Escalation**

First, let's check our current privileges on the machine by running `sudo -l`

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/lyanyu/13.png)

We can run the command `pkexec` as root. Let's go to [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/pkexec/) to see what we can do.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/lyanyu/15.png)

We see that we ca run `sudo pkexec /bin/sh` to escalate to root. Let's do it.

![](/assets/img/tryhackme/lyanyu/14.png)

Great! We have successfully rooted this machine.
